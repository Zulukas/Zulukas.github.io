                    <h3>Navigation</h3>

                    <p>
                        Added a hover text color change for my navbar.  This will help to
                        increase the visual and functional continuity of my sight as the
                        changes were made.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I didn't make any other changes to my navbar because from what I read
                        this week I feel like it conforms to design standards.  It's in a clear
                        and easy place to reach.  There isn't any ambiguity about where each
                        link will take you.  See

                        Navigation isn’t just a feature of a web site, it is the web site, 
                        in the same way that the building, the shelves, and the cash registers 
                        are Sears. Without it, there’s no there there. -Steve Krug

                    <h3>Overall Design</h3>

                    <p>
                        I didn't make any actual changes to my site.  Namely because from the
                        reading this week I guess I'm not really seeing anything that is wrong
                        with what they described in their pages.  

                        <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/index.html" target="_blank">
                            This page
                        </a>

                        talks about how it's important for a site to be clear, orderly, and seems
                        trustworthy.  A user should seem confident in a page when they first view
                        it and I don't have any reason from either myself, or those I have shown
                        my site to, to believe that there is anything generally wrong with the 
                        layout.

                        <li>
                            Create a clear and visual hierarchy of constrast, so you can see at a 
                            glance what is important and what is peripheral.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Define functional regions of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Group page elements that are related, so that you can see the structure in the content.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

                    <p>
                        For this particular assignment this week I kind of struggled in understand
                        exactly what was being asked of me.  It wasn't necessarily that I didn't 
                        understand the assignment, because I read it through several times.  It was
                        more rather that the web page we were required to read this week was
                        <i>extremely</i> verbose and it was hard to take everything that you were
                        supposed to take out of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If I can be critical of their site and analyze it a bit, what they <i>really</i>
                        need is a synopsis.  This because you don't want to read through every single 
                        page every time you have a question about a topic.  It is pretty difficult to 
                        navigate their site for that reason.  You have a question about how graphics should
                        contribute and you're faced with a wall of text and a creepy painting of a crab.  The
                        following pages on what graphics to use are really distracting because all of a sudden you have
                        a page long image about whales.  Your train of thought is disrupted and you're trying to
                        understand what they have to say about whales, not what constitutes good images that 
                        add a new level of understanding for your readers.  At least that is what happened to me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So for some closing thoughts, I did my best to understand what I was supposed to take out
                        of this week, but I'm pretty lost to be perfectly honest.  There was a <b>lot</b> of material
                        to take in and very little context to put it behind.  With little context, a lot of that material
                        being brought in is sent to your brain's temporary memory and isn't stored like it 
                        should be.  From what I got is that your website should be easy to navigate, clearly define
                        what it's purpose is, and readily present information and/or services to the user.  Images should
                        add to what's being portrayed, not distract, and not to just decorate (unless it's related).
