                One of my favorite quotes, which comes from Jim Lovell an astronaut on
                Apollo 8 and 13.  This quote comes from his interview in the 2007 movie
                <i>In the Shadow of the Moon</i>
                <blockquote>
                    <font color="green">
                        We learned a lot about the Moon, but what we really learned
                        was about the Earth. The fact that just from the distance of the Moon
                        you can put your thumb up and you can hide the Earth behind your thumb.
                        Everything that you've ever known, your loved ones, your business,
                        the problems of the Earth itself-all behind your thumb. And how
                        insignificant we really all are, but then how fortunate we are to have
                        this body and to be able to enjoy loving here amongst the beauty of the
                        Earth itself.

                Another one of my personal favorites, given by Alan Shephard:

                <blockquote>
                    <font color="red">
                        If somebody'd said before the flight, "Are you going to get carried away
                        looking at the earth from the moon?" I would have say, "No, no way." But
                        yet when I first looked back at the earth, standing on the moon, I cried.
                    </font>
