    notes:  validator.w3.org complains about me using the <font></font> tag, however we are explicitly
            told to use inline styles for borders, colors, etc.  So I wasn't sure what to do here

            One of my favorite quotes, which comes from Jim Lovell an astronaut on
            Apollo 8 and 13.  This quote comes from his interview in the 2007 movie
            <i>In the Shadow of the Moon</i>
        </font>

        <blockquote>
            <font color="green">
                We learned a lot about the Moon, but what we really learned
                was about the Earth. The fact that just from the distance of the Moon
                you can put your thumb up and you can hide the Earth behind your thumb.
                Everything that you've ever known, your loved ones, your business,
                the problems of the Earth itself-all behind your thumb. And how
                insignificant we really all are, but then how fortunate we are to have
                this body and to be able to enjoy loving here amongst the beauty of the
                Earth itself.

            Another one of my personal favorites, given by Alan Shephard:
        </font>

        <blockquote>
            <font color="red">
                If somebody'd said before the flight, "Are you going to get carried away
                looking at the earth from the moon?" I would have say, "No, no way." But
                yet when I first looked back at the earth, standing on the moon, I cried.
            </font>
